# What should I Eat?
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
### Why I designed the app:
I have always had troubles when it comes to figuring out what to eat with my friends and coworkers, and using online tools can be too much of a hassle too since I have to type in potential options each time, and it most likely just randomly select 1. Therefore, I wanted to create a project that solves just that! This program is designed to help users decide what to eat for their next meal. It provides several potential options for the user to choose from.

### Features:
1. Randomly choose 1 food from the list: This is the simpliest option. Should the user created the list through the in-program option beforehand, the program will list out all potential food options from the list and will randomly picks one for the user.

2. Help users decide by comparing two food: This one is one of the more intersting features. Sometimes I use one of those online "randomly draw one" website but ended up finding myself not wanting to eat the food option it has picked for me. This function will randomly shuffle all food from the list and list 2 foods for users to pick. The winner will be re-added to the list and the loser will be dropped. This is a bit similiar to winning a championship.
